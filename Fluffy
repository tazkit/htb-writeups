## **Initial Access â€“ Provided Credentials**

This box provides you with a low lever user credentials to simulate what a low-privileged insider or compromised workstation account could access. This simulates a **post-phishing or credential-leak scenario**, where attackers already have a foothold but want to escalate privileges.

Domain user account:

Username: j.fleischman
Password: J0elTHEM4n1990!

# Enumeration

After obtaining initial access using the provided credentials, I began by verifying SMB access with `crackmapexec`. My goal here was to confirm the credentials were valid.
